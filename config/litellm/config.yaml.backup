    description: gpt-oss-120b is an open-weight, 117B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts
      (MoE) language model from OpenAI designed for high-reasoning, agentic, and general-purpose
      production use cases. It activates 5.1B parameters per forward pass and is optimized
      to run on a single H100 GPU with native MXFP4 quantization. The model supports
      configurable reasoning depth, full chain-of-thought access, and native tool
      use, including function calling, browsing, and structured output generation.
